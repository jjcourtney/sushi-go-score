- Find out who has the highest score in round 1 they get given 6 points if there is a tie then they get the point divided between them.
- If there is no tie for first place then check to see if there is a tie for second place (if there is then the 3 points get divided between them). Else the second place gets 3 points.
- These steps get repeated for round 2 and 3.
